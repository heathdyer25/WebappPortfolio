# Calculator

**[Link to Index](/Calculator/index.html)**

This is an implementation of a basic calcultor. Under js in calculator.js, I created an FSM for the calculator that controls how it operates. Every button delegates to the calculators transition() function and works from there. It's pretty cool!
